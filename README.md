Hi, I'm Tim Sullivan, and I am a data enthusiast.  There's something very satisfying about taking raw data, cleaning them, and then running various analyses on them to glean insights and inform a wide array of decisions.  
This portfolio showcases some of the abilities I have in the data analytics domain.
As with most things in life, I doubt that a given person can ever know everything there is to know about data analysis.
It is my goal in life to become ever better at analyzing and visualizing data.
